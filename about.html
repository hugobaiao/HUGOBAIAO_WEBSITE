        <h2 class="aboutme">I'll use this page to talk a little bit more about myself.</h2>
        <p class="about-p1">I've always been interested in computers and anything technology related all my life. Besides maybe music production, I can't think of anything else I'd rather do. From working with home servers and different Linux distributions to web development and technical support.</p>

        <p class="about-p2">As I mentioned, music production is also something I really like, as well as working on DJ sets and mixing in general. I occasionally stream on Twitch. Here's a list of other places you can find me:</p>
